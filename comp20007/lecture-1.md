**Important exam formulas:**

- simple ones like triangular numbers - should have in your head
- harder ones you aren't expected to memorise at all.

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

## Examples of algorithmic problems

- sorting
- graph colouring - adjacent objects can't have the same colour - how many colours do you need for any graph?
- equation solving problems

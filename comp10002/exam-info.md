## Exam Information

Algorithms litmus tests:
- functional growth rates & principles of analysis
- dictionary data structures, including arrays, lists and binary search trees, and their tradeoffs and costs.
- binary and linear search
- general appreciation of O(n log(n))-time sorting algorithms
- problem solving techniques and their various application domains

To score well:
- Details of int and float number representations
- Program correctness arguments, and **formulation of loop invariants**
- Pattern matching and string search algorithms (KMP, Boyer Moore)
- Functions of recursive structures (lists and trees)
- Details of quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, including of their analysis and relative merits
  - (will not get told - "implement mergesort")
  - *don't* use quicksort in safety critical situations because might be O(n^2)
- details of dictionary structures using arrays, trees and lists, including hashing.
- **priority queues, including an implementation via a heap.**

To score really well (separate 85 from 95):
- some creativity / insight
- adapting something you've been shown for a different purpose
- analysis of a new algorithm, or something covered only in passing in the lectures
  - some asymptotic behaviour that is much more complex
- work backwards from an analysis, to derive an algorithm that meets it - putting together knowledge from different parts of the subject.

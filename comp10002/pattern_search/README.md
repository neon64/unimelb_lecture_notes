# Introduction to Pattern Search

[[back to COMP10002 home]](../README.md)

**Given:** a text sequence <img src="svgs/0a007ca4b91550a6017b7c79204efae8.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=76.55069399999998pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>

**Question:** how do you find whether a particular pattern occurs in that string?

**Example:** text is  `she shlls she shella by the she shells shore`, pattern is `she shells`. What is the fastest (most algorithmically efficient) way to check if `she shells` is in the search text?

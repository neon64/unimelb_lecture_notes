# Introduction to Pattern Search

[[back to COMP10002 home]](../README.md)

**Given:** a text sequence $T[0..n-1]$

**Question:** how do you find whether a particular pattern occurs in that string?

**Example:** text is  `she shlls she shella by the she shells shore`, pattern is `she shells`. What is the fastest (most algorithmically efficient) way to check if `she shells` is in the search text?

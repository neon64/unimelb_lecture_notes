# COMP10002 - Foundations of Algorithms (Semester 2, 2019)

Assorted lecture notes from Foundations of Algorithms, Semester 2, 2019, with Professor Alistair Moffat and Dr Artem Polyvyanyy as lecturer.

## Table of Contents

#### Notes grouped by topic:

- [Pattern Search (BMH, KMP, suffix arrays)](./pattern_search/README.md)
- [Exam tips from final lecture](./exam-tips.md)

#### Disorganised, lecture-by-lecture notes:

These lecture notes are compiled roughly based upon which in-person lecture they appeared in, however I have taken the liberty to move some things around and combine multiple lectures into one file, hence there is no longer exactly 3 lectures per week for 12 weeks.

Please note: many of the notes for these topics are extremely scarce. This is because I didn't take copious notes on topics which I already felt I was familiar with (e.g.: malloc, structs, arrays, functions, lots of simple C concepts). In the future I may expand these notes into a comprehensive guide for the subject.

- [Lecture 1.1](./lecture-1.1.md) - introduction
- [Lecture 1.3](./lecture-1.3.md) - getting started with C

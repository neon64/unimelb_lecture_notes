# COMP10002 - Foundations of Algorithms (Semester 2, 2020)

Assorted lecture notes from Foundations of Algorithms, Semester 2, 2019, with Professor Alistair Moffat and Dr Artem Polyvyanyy as lecturer.

## Table of Contents

These lecture notes are compiled roughly based upon which in-person lecture they appeared in, however I have taken the liberty to move some things around and combine multiple lectures into one file, hence there is no longer exactly 3 lectures per week for 12 weeks.
